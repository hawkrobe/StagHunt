## Classic Stag Hunt Game Theory

### Skyrms, B. (2004). *The Stag Hunt and the Evolution of Social Structure*. Cambridge University Press.

**Key Contribution:** The seminal modern treatment of stag hunt games, extending Rousseau's original parable into a comprehensive framework for understanding cooperation and collective action. Skyrms examines how evolutionary dynamics, network structure, and signaling affect coordination on efficient vs. risk-dominant equilibria.

**Core Concepts:**
- Contrasts risk-dominant equilibrium (hunting hare—safe but low payoff) with payoff-dominant equilibrium (hunting stag—risky but high reward)
- Explores how network topology and spatial structure affect equilibrium selection
- Analyzes role of signals and communication in facilitating coordination
- Uses evolutionary game theory and replicator dynamics to model strategy evolution

**Relevance:** Provides the theoretical foundation for understanding tension between risk and reward in coordination games. Essential for interpreting behavioral data in stag hunt paradigms.

**Structure:** Part I: Location (spatial structure), Part II: Signals (communication), Part III: Association (network formation)

---

### Rousseau, J.-J. (1755/1984). *A Discourse on Inequality*.

**Original Quote:** "If it was a matter of hunting a deer, everyone well realized that he must remain faithful to his post; but if a hare happened to pass within reach of one of them, we cannot doubt that he would have gone off in pursuit of it without scruple."

**Historical Significance:** The foundational story from which the stag hunt game derives. Rousseau uses this parable to illustrate the fundamental tension in forming social contracts—the conflict between individual self-interest (guaranteed smaller reward) and collective benefit (larger reward requiring mutual trust).

**Key Insight:** Highlights that cooperation requires commitment even when safer alternatives are available, presaging modern game-theoretic analyses of assurance games.

---

### Crawford, V. P., & Haller, H. (1990). Learning how to cooperate: Optimal play in repeated coordination games. *Econometrica*, 58(3), 571-595.

**Key Contribution:** Theoretical analysis of how players learn to coordinate in repeated games with multiple equilibria. Develops framework for understanding equilibrium selection through adaptive learning.

**Main Results:**
- Analyzes renegotiation-proof equilibria in repeated coordination games
- Shows how history-dependent strategies can support efficient coordination
- Demonstrates role of conventions in resolving coordination problems

**Relevance:** Provides theoretical tools for understanding how stable coordination patterns emerge over repeated interactions.

## Continuous Time Stag Hunt

### Zhao, S. (2020). Coordination Games in Continuous Time. SSRN Working Paper.

**Key Contribution:** First systematic experimental study comparing continuous-time vs. discrete-time interaction in stag hunt and battle-of-the-sexes games. Demonstrates that continuous time facilitates better coordination.

**Experimental Design:**
- 3×2×2 factorial design: 3 payoff matrices × 2 time treatments (continuous/discrete) × 2 action sets (pure/mixed)
- 60-second rounds with real-time strategy adjustment in continuous condition
- Tracks full trajectories of strategy evolution within rounds

**Main Findings:**
- Subjects coordinate significantly better in continuous time than discrete time
- Continuous time increases likelihood of converging to payoff-dominant equilibrium in stag hunt
- Treatment effect results from faster within-round learning in continuous time
- Complexity of action sets (pure vs. mixed) also affects coordination rate

**Methodological Innovation:** Uses joint density heat maps to visualize strategy profiles over time, showing clustering patterns around equilibria.

**Relevance:** Directly comparable to the current study's paradigm—demonstrates that continuous-time interaction fundamentally changes coordination dynamics compared to simultaneous move games.

---

### Frey, S., & Goldstone, R. L. (2010). Group Stratification and Coordination Failure in a Continuous N-Player Stag Hunt. Proceedings of the Cognitive Science Society.

**Key Contribution:** Extends stag hunt to N-player continuous-time setting, showing how group size affects coordination failure.

**Key Findings:**
- Larger groups show increased coordination failure
- Group stratification emerges with some players coordinating while others defect
- Continuous action space reveals dynamics invisible in discrete games

**Relevance:** Shows scalability challenges of stag hunt coordination and how continuous action spaces affect emergent patterns.

## Experimental Stag Hunt (Laboratory Economics)

### Battalio, R., Samuelson, L., & Van Huyck, J. (2001). Optimization incentives and coordination failure in laboratory stag hunt games. *Econometrica*, 69(3), 749-764.

**Key Contribution:** Landmark experimental study showing that the "optimization premium" (incentive to play best response) affects coordination outcomes in stag hunt games.

**Experimental Design:**
- Three stag hunt games with identical best-response structure but different optimization incentives
- 70-75 rounds per game, random rematching each round
- Cohorts of 8 subjects

**Main Findings:**
- Higher optimization premiums increase likelihood of efficient (payoff-dominant) coordination
- Risk dominance alone does not fully predict behavior
- Learning dynamics show path dependence—early successes breed later coordination
- Subjects display "conditional expectations" linking strategy choice to perceived optimization incentives

**Theoretical Implication:** Challenges pure risk-dominance prediction; suggests optimization incentives matter beyond strategic uncertainty.

**Relevance:** Demonstrates that payoff structure details matter for equilibrium selection in repeated play.

### Schmidt, D., Shupp, R., Walker, J. M., & Ostrom, E. (2003). Playing safe in coordination games: The roles of risk dominance, payoff dominance, and history of play. *Games and Economic Behavior*, 42(2), 281-299.

**Key Contribution:** Comprehensive experimental study examining relative importance of risk dominance, payoff dominance, and learning history in determining coordination outcomes.

**Experimental Design:**
- Multiple stag hunt games varying in basin of attraction for each equilibrium
- Fixed pairs playing repeated rounds
- Manipulation of both payoff structure and history of play

**Main Findings:**
- History of play (successful coordination in early rounds) strongly predicts future coordination
- Both risk and payoff dominance affect behavior, but their relative influence varies
- Fixed pairing enhances coordination on efficient equilibrium compared to random matching

**Key Insight:** Coordination is multiply determined—no single principle (risk dominance, payoff dominance, or efficiency) fully explains behavior.

**Relevance:** Shows importance of interaction history and partner-specific learning in coordination games.

---

### Cooper, R., DeJong, D. V., Forsythe, R., & Ross, T. W. (1992). Communication in coordination games. *Quarterly Journal of Economics*, 107(2), 739-771.

**Key Contribution:** First major experimental study of how communication affects coordination in stag hunt games.

**Main Findings:**
- Pre-play communication dramatically increases coordination on payoff-dominant equilibrium
- Even non-binding "cheap talk" communication facilitates coordination
- One-way communication is less effective than two-way communication
- Communication acts as a coordination device by making intentions public

**Relevance:** Establishes communication as critical mechanism for overcoming strategic uncertainty in coordination games.

### Hallers-Haalboom, E. T., De Jaegher, K. J. M., Sterck, E. H. M., Brosnan, S. F., & Vermande, M. M. (2025). Communication increases cooperation among students in a coordination game. *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences*, 122(35), e2517669122.

**Key Contribution:** Recent extension showing communication improves coordination even when participants must *infer* game structure through repeated play (rather than being told payoffs explicitly).

**Experimental Design:**
- 127 same-sex dyads playing 40 rounds of online Stag Hunt
- Communication vs. no-communication conditions
- Payoff structure not disclosed—must be discovered through play

**Main Findings:**
- Coordination on payoff-dominant outcome increases over trials only with communication
- Communication enables joint discovery of optimal strategies
- No significant sex differences in coordination success

**Novel Contribution:** Shows communication facilitates both *information discovery* and *coordination*, not just the latter.

**Relevance:** Highlights role of communication in environments with incomplete information—directly relevant for tasks where optimal strategies must be learned.

### Rankin, F. W., Van Huyck, J. B., & Battalio, R. C. (2000). Strategic similarity and emergent conventions: Evidence from similar stag hunt games. *Games and Economic Behavior*, 32(2), 315-337.

**Key Contribution:** Studies convention formation across strategically similar but payoff-distinct stag hunt games.

**Experimental Design:**
- Subjects play sequence of stag hunt games with randomized payoffs and scrambled action labels
- Preserves strategic structure (efficiency, risk dominance) while varying surface features
- Tests whether abstract strategic principles guide behavior

**Main Findings:**
- Conventions emerge in half of cohorts despite constantly changing payoffs
- When conventions emerge, they conform to efficiency rather than security or risk dominance
- Strategic similarity alone (without salient labels) can support convention formation

**Theoretical Implication:** Subjects can abstract strategic principles beyond specific payoffs, but convention formation is fragile.

---

### Van Huyck, J. B., Battalio, R. C., & Beil, R. O. (1990). Tacit coordination games, strategic uncertainty, and coordination failure. *American Economic Review*, 80(1), 234-248.

**Key Contribution:** Classic study demonstrating coordination failure in minimum-effort games (closely related to stag hunt).

**Main Finding:** Large groups consistently fail to coordinate on efficient equilibrium, instead converging to minimum effort (risk-dominant) outcome.

**Key Insight:** Strategic uncertainty in large groups creates strong pressure toward risk-dominant (safe) choices even when efficiency losses are substantial.

**Relevance:** Shows scale-dependence of coordination—larger groups face greater coordination challenges.

## Continuous Spatial Coordination Paradigms

### Hawkins, R. D., & Goldstone, R. L. (2016). The Formation of Social Conventions in Real-Time Environments. *PLOS ONE*, 11(3), e0151670.

**Key Contribution:** Demonstrates that continuity of interaction (real-time vs. simultaneous) dramatically affects convention formation in coordination games.

**Experimental Design:**
- Impure coordination game with high/low stakes conditions
- Real-time continuous interaction vs. simultaneous decision-making
- Payoff asymmetry creates tension between efficiency and fairness

**Main Findings:**
- Real-time interaction leads to greater efficiency and fairness than simultaneous decisions
- High stakes amplify effect of real-time interaction on convention stability
- Low stakes allow satisfactory "on-the-fly" coordination without stable conventions
- High stakes create pressure to establish persistent cross-round expectations

**Theoretical Contribution:** Introduces concept of "social canalization"—interaction between within-trial dynamics and across-trial learning.

**Key Insight:** Continuous time allows players to signal intentions and respond dynamically within each interaction, fundamentally changing coordination process.

**Methodological Innovation:** Fine-grained analysis of movement trajectories reveals continuous negotiation processes invisible in discrete-choice paradigms. Provides precedent for studying coordination in continuous spatial environments. Stag hunt task extends this to spatial navigation with multiple prey options.

**Key Contribution:** Studies spontaneous coordination in continuous spatial shepherding task where pairs must corral virtual sheep. Reveals emergent coordination patterns and mode-switching dynamics.

**Experimental Paradigm:**
- Pairs navigate virtual environment to keep sheep clustered in center
- Continuous joystick control of avatar position
- Sheep have autonomous movement based on flocking algorithms

**Main Findings:**
- All pairs initially adopt "search-and-recover" mode: complementary, divided labor strategy
- Significant subset spontaneously discover "coupled oscillatory containment": synchronized coordinated oscillation
- Both modes emerge from task's intrinsic dynamics
- Mode switches represent discovery of more efficient coordination patterns

**Theoretical Framework:** Uses dynamical systems theory to model coordination as emergent attractor states.

**Methodological Innovation:**
- Tracks full continuous trajectories of both players and sheep
- Uses relative phase analysis to quantify interpersonal coordination
- Computational modeling (HKB model) captures coordination dynamics

**Relevance:** 
- Demonstrates spontaneous emergence of coordination strategies in continuous spatial tasks
- Shows that effective strategies may not be initially apparent—requiring discovery through interaction
- Provides precedent for analyzing continuous movement coordination with dynamical systems tools

**Comparison to Stag Hunt Task:** Similar continuous spatial navigation, but without explicit payoff structure (stag/hare tradeoff) and strategic prey selection.

**Key Contribution:** Extends shepherding paradigm to human–agent interaction using dynamical motor primitives (DMPs) to create human-like artificial agents.

**Key Innovation:** Shows that artificial agents modeled on human coordination dynamics can achieve equivalent performance to human–human dyads and are perceived as human-like (passing "Turing-like" test).

**Main Findings:**
- DMP-based agents coordinate as effectively as humans in shepherding task
- Most participants couldn't distinguish human from artificial partners
- Validates isomorphism between human and computational coordination dynamics

**Relevance:** 
- Demonstrates computational modeling approach for continuous spatial coordination
- Shows that relatively simple dynamical principles can capture complex coordination
- Provides template for modeling partner behavior in stag hunt task

### Richardson, M. J., Marsh, K. L., & Schmidt, R. C. (2005). Effects of visual and verbal interaction on unintentional interpersonal coordination. *Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance*, 31(1), 62-79.

**Key Contribution:** Shows that visual coupling leads to spontaneous interpersonal coordination even without explicit coordination goals.

**Main Findings:**
- Pairs spontaneously synchronize rhythmic movements when visually coupled
- Verbal interaction modulates coordination strength
- Coordination emerges from perceptual-motor coupling, not intentional strategies

**Theoretical Framework:** Applies Haken-Kelso-Bunz (HKB) model of coordination dynamics to social interaction.

**Relevance:** Shows that continuous visual monitoring creates implicit coordination pressures—relevant for understanding how players track partners in spatial coordination tasks.

## Cooperative Hunting & Pursuit-Evasion

### Tang, N., Gong, S., Zhao, M., Gu, C., Zhou, J., Shen, M., & Gao, T. (2022). Exploring an Imagined "We" in Human Collective Hunting: Joint Commitment within Shared Intentionality. *Proceedings of the Cognitive Science Society*, 44.

**Key Contribution:** **Tao Gao's flagship work** on cooperative hunting using real-time behavioral game with multiple prey. Develops "Imagined We" (IW) computational model of joint commitment.

**Experimental Paradigm:**
- Real-time cooperative hunting game requiring two players to jointly catch fast-moving prey
- Multiple potential prey targets simultaneously available
- Heavy reliance on visual perception and continuous spatial tracking
- Players must commit to same target without explicit communication

**Key Findings:**
- Humans maintain robust cooperation even with many alternative targets
- Joint commitment framework (IW model) better captures human behavior than reward-sharing models
- IW model imagines supraindividual agent ("We") whose intentions guide individual behavior
- Bayesian inference used to infer joint intentions

**Computational Models Compared:**
- **Imagined We (IW):** Each player infers intention of collective "We" agent
- **Reward Sharing (RS):** Players maximize individual rewards from shared outcomes
- IW outperforms RS especially as target number increases

**Theoretical Contribution:** Formalizes "shared intentionality" from philosophical/developmental psychology in computational framework.

**Direct Relevance:** 
- Most similar existing paradigm to stag hunt task
- Real-time continuous hunting with multiple prey
- Requires joint commitment to single target
- **Key difference:** stag hunt payoff structure (solo-catchable hare vs. cooperative-only stag)

**Key Contribution:** Foundational work on how humans perceive pursuit/chasing from motion alone.

**Experimental Method:** Parametrically varies motion characteristics of "wolf" and "sheep" discs to identify cues for perceiving chasing.

**Main Finding:** Humans rapidly and automatically detect chasing relationships based on spatial-temporal contingencies—chaser orients toward target and takes pursuit trajectory.

**Relevance:** 
- Shows humans are highly attuned to pursuit dynamics
- Relevant for understanding how players perceive partner intentions in spatial hunting tasks
- Suggests players may automatically infer partner goals from movement patterns

- Predators trained with shared reward function

**Main Findings:**
- Role differentiation emerges spontaneously (chaser, blocker, ambusher)
- Collaborative patterns emerge without explicit theory-of-mind mechanisms
- Simple mapping from states to actions sufficient for apparent sophistication

**Theoretical Implication:** Challenges view that collaborative hunting requires high-level cognition.

## Additional Relevant Topics

### Pursuit-Evasion in Robotics/AI

While most robotics work focuses on autonomous agents rather than human behavior, some relevant computational frameworks include:

- **Differential games approach:** Treats pursuit-evasion as optimal control problem
- **Multi-agent reinforcement learning:** Recent approaches showing emergent coordinated pursuit
- **Game-theoretic modeling:** Nash equilibria in pursuit-evasion scenarios

**Note:** Most robotics literature is tangential to behavioral questions, but computational models may be useful for modeling partner behavior or creating autonomous agents for experiments.

## Synthesis and Gaps

### What Makes Our Paradigm Novel?

1. **Stag hunt payoff structure** in continuous spatial environment
   - *Stag hunt literature:* Mostly discrete simultaneous-move games
   - *Spatial coordination literature:* Lacks explicit stag hunt tradeoff
   
2. **Real-time continuous movement** with strategic prey selection
   - *Continuous coordination (Hawkins, Nalepka):* Present but without stag hunt structure
   - *Cooperative hunting (Gao):* Continuous but without solo-catchable alternatives
   
3. **Multiple prey with different payoff/difficulty tradeoffs**
   - *Game theory:* Stag hunt typically two options
   - *Behavioral hunting:* Often single prey or undifferentiated alternatives
